# ML
Machine learning projects
This is a collection of a few ML starter projects using some of the common frameworks such as pytorch, Keras, Darknet(for YOLO).
Most of these projects were part of the coursework from:
- OpenCV.org (https://opencv.org/courses/) 
- Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) 
- Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/course/intel-edge-ai-for-iot-developers-nanodegree--nd131)
All of the above are excellant resources!
