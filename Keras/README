Description: These notebooks are basic keras based samples that can be run on colab.

1. Fine_tuning_VGG_fruits_dataset.ipynb - Transfer Learning exps
- Freezing all layers (just changing the FC and o/p layer)
- Initial layers fixed and only retrain the last 4 layers

2. Keras_CNN_CIFAR10.ipynb - Keras training workflow
- Loading and visualizing images from CIFAR10 dataset
- Normalizing the images
- create a basic model with 6 conv + 1 FC layer
- Perform Training and visualize the Loss/Accuracy curves
- Use the trained model for sample inference

3. Keras_Pretrained_Classification_Models.ipynb- Inference using pre-trained models
- Loading models pre-trained on Imagenet- vgg16, inception_v3, resnet50, mobilenet and performing inference.
